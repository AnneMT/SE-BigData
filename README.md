"""
 Security Enhanced Big Data Processing Analyzer
   Finite State Machine used to analyze probable attacks 
   and probable security service control defenses to
   model downtime and degraded operations.
   

 This Python Program models a Finite Statem Machine (FSM) that demonstrates 
 the value of security mechanisms in a Big Data Processing (BDP) architecture.
 Spreadsheets listing the security attacks and security service conrols for
 5 different BDP architecture models (A to E) are used as input.
 Through the execution of transitions between five states, probable
 effectiveness of cybersecurity attacks and defenses are evaluated.
 The ouput graph and data demonstrate that investments in cybersecurity
 mechanisms provide significantly lower down time and minimize the impact
 of operating in a degraded state.
 
 Input File Names: data-control-attack.xls and input-control-attack.xls
 
 Example Output Data is in the spreadsheet:  data-for-plotting.xls
